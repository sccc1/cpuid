AMD: Ryzen/Zen (Q1 2017)

These are not really future, but I have very little data on them:

   Intel: Atom S12x9 (Briarwood) is based on Cedarview, but the Intel docs provide
          no CPUID identification values.  And I can find no examples online.  Does
          anyone know the CPUID family/model/steppings?
   Intel: I can find no cpuid information on Atom C1000 or Z2000.
          (Possibly they are (0,6),(2,7) or (0,6),(3,5)?)
   AMD: Geneva (the Athlon II Neo counterpart of the Athlon II mobile Champlain, 
                or the V-Series Champlain?) 
               [not seen in any revision guides yet, though]
   VIA: Nano 1000/2000 (Isaiah)
   VIA: Nano 3000
